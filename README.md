# AutoCoder

Repo for Hyperskill AutoCoder project.

To use the AutoCoder, run the `main.py` file. The program will ask you to enter the text you want to encode or decode,
and then it will ask you to enter the shift value. The program will then encode or decode the text using the Caesar
cipher and print the result.

The program will keep running until you enter `exit` as the text to encode or decode.

The program will only encode or decode letters. All other characters will be left unchanged.

The program will also only encode or decode letters in the English alphabet. The program will not encode or decode
